# Basic RAG System Starter Pack

## Project Overview

This project provides a simple, modular setup for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, combining document retrieval and language generation to answer queries based on a specified knowledge base. Designed as a beginner-friendly toolkit, it helps you build foundational RAG workflows from scratch.

**Main Components:**
1. **Retriever**: Locates relevant documents based on a query.
2. **Generator**: Creates natural language responses from retrieved documents.

## Why Use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?

RAG systems combine the strengths of retrieval (finding relevant information) and generation (producing human-like text) to create an efficient system for answering questions, summarizing information, and more. This project is ideal for anyone looking to understand and implement a basic RAG setup without the complexity of a large-scale deployment.

**Common Use Cases:**
- **Customer Support**: Answer common queries using pre-existing documentation.
- **Research Assistance**: Quickly retrieve information from research papers or databases.
- **Knowledge Summarization**: Generate concise summaries of extensive knowledge sources.

## Project Structure

This project is organized into the following folders:
- **docs/**: Documentation and setup instructions.
- **src/**: Core code files, including the retriever and generator.
- **examples/**: Example scripts to help you test and modify the setup.
- **assets/**: Images, charts, or other media for documentation and tutorials.

### Core Code

1. **Retriever Module (`retriever.py`)**: Uses vector embeddings and cosine similarity to identify relevant documents.
2. **Generator Module (`generator.py`)**: Generates responses using a language model like GPT-2 (or any compatible model) to provide coherent answers based on the retrieved information.

### Installation & Setup

See the `README.md` for installation instructions and prerequisites.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this project from GitHub to your local environment.
2. **Install Requirements**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the dependencies.
3. **Test the Example**: Run the example script in `examples/retrieve_example.py` to see the retriever in action.

## Future Enhancements

This project serves as a basic RAG starter pack. Future improvements could include:
- Integration with vector databases (e.g., FAISS or Pinecone) for faster and scalable retrieval.
- Support for fine-tuning both retrievers and generators with domain-specific data.
- Additional retrieval methods, including keyword-based and hybrid search.
